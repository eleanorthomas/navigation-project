## Learning Algorithm

The learning algorithm used was a Deep Q Network with an underlying neural network using three 64-unit fully connected layers and relu activation functions.

## Plot of Rewards

The following is a plot of the rewards for the trained agent showing the 414 episodes it took to solve the problem. Over the last 100 episodes, the average score was 13.01:

## Ideas for Future Work

The initial implementation was able to solve the task fairly quickly, but further optimization of hyperparameters could result in a quicker solution.
